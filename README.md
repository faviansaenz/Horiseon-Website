# My motivation for this project challenge was to come out learning something new and to help myself with better understanding of the workplace and the process of which. I built this project to keep track all of the necessary steps. The problem that I solved in this project was editing a website to meet accessibility standards. During this project I learned that using alt tags allows you to add text to images that describes the images.
